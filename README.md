Multi Tenant Role Based Access Control (RBAC) Authentication API
---

### Multi-Tenant Application Overview:

This software architecture is designed to serve multiple users or tenants on a shared infrastructure, a perfect fit for scalable and cost-effective cloud-based services. In a multi-tenant setup, a single application instance runs on a server, accommodating various clients or organizations referred to as "tenants."

### Key Features:

- #### Isolation for Customization: 
  Each tenant enjoys a customized experience without affecting others. Data, configurations, and user settings are neatly separated, allowing tailored adjustments for individual needs.

- #### Resource Efficiency: 
  By sharing a common codebase and infrastructure, multi-tenancy optimizes resource utilization and reduces operational costs. It's a powerful solution for maintaining consistency while serving diverse user requirements.
